Compile-time assertion for standard C
=====================================

Assert a compile time dependency by static definition or expressions.

- STATIC_ASSERT(cond, msg) - assert a compile time dependency by static definition.
- STATIC_ASSERT_OR_TYPE(cond, msg) - assert a compile time dependency, as a struct type.
- STATIC_ASSERT_OR_ZERO(cond, msg) - assert a compile time dependency, as an expression: its value is "0".

Two arguments are passed in:
  - cond: the compile-time condition which must be true.
  - msg: a valid identifier which may be displayed as the error message.
