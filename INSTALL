Build
=====
In general you can build:
      ./configure

Use 'make' to build the library and 'make doxygen-doc'
to build API documents. 'make check" will build test programs
and 'make install' will copy all required headers and binary files
to the install directory.

For information on configuration options see:
# ./configure --help
